## Running the sample using Docker

You can run the Web sample by running these commands from the root folder (where the .sln file is located):

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to make requests to localhost:5200 for the Web API, and localhost:5201 for the Web project once these commands complete. If you have any problems, especially with login. User name witcherfearless and password 12345678

You can also run the applications by using the instructions located in their `Dockerfile` file in the root of each project. Again, run these commands from the root of the solution (where the .sln file is located).
